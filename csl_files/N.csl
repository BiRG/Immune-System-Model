! Neutrophils are normally found in the blood stream. During the beginning
! (acute) phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, 
! environmental exposure, and some cancers, neutrophils are one of the 
! first-responders of inflammatory cells to migrate towards the site of inflammation. 
! They migrate through the blood vessels, then through interstitial tissue, following 
! chemical signals such as Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and C5a in a process called chemotaxis. 
! They are the predominant cells in pus, accounting for its whitish/yellowish appearance.
